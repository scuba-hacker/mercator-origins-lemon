The Lemon M5 Stick sits in the GPS float box and is the virtual umbilical from the Diver to/from the interwebs via WiFi (a TP-Link MiFi hotspot or mobile phone with hotspot can be placed in the float box too). It also has responsibility for filtering out the tonne of GPS NMEA sentence messages from 10 or so a second down to 2 per second - ie just the location messages - before sending down to the diver console (the Mako M5 Stick).
